# MYSTIC Project

## Overview
MYSTIC is a sophisticated analytical system that combines advanced mathematical techniques, quantum-inspired algorithms, and predictive modeling to solve complex computational challenges. The system integrates various analytical approaches including K-Elimination theorems, Quantum Mathematical Number Finding (QMNF), and toric period finding methodologies.

## Features
- Advanced mathematical analysis using K-Elimination theorems
- Quantum Mathematical Number Finding (QMNF) implementations
- Predictive analytics and gap analysis capabilities
- Integration with NINE65 systems
- Comprehensive validation and testing frameworks
- Multi-variable analytical capabilities

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy/SciPy ecosystem
- Specialized mathematical libraries
- Advanced algorithmic frameworks

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `frontend/`: Frontend components (if applicable)
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `skills/`: Specialized skill modules
- `synthetic_data/`: Synthetic data generation and processing

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
